{"editorCode":" ;\t       Clock out of tune\n;\n;Stella made the procedure \"clock\" in order to make the avatar show the time. She thought about the relation between the hour hand and the minute hand; she wanted to move the minute hand independently, and the hour hand to depend on the minute hand movement. But when she ran the procedure she saw that the clock was out of tune. Can you help her fix it?\n\n;----------------        \n;----------------\n;For further instructions click on the papyrus button.\n;----------------        \n;-----------------\n;procedure\n;...............\nto clock :r :h :m :x\nblack\ndisc :r\nblue\nrt 30*:h + :x\nhour_hand :r/30\nred\nrt 11/2*:m-30*:h\nminute_hand :r/40\nend\n\n\nclean\nclock 120 1 50 -5\n\n;=====================\n;=====================\nto disc :r\nrepeat 12 [arc1 :r point :r]\nrepeat 12 [arc2 :r+3]\nrepeat 12 [arc2 :r+6]\npu setxy 0 0 pd \nend\n\n;-------------\n\nto arc1 :r \npu setxy 0 0 lt 90 fd :r rt 90 pd\nrepeat 5 [repeat 6 [fd :r *pi/180 rt 1] point1 :r]\nend\n\n\n;---------------\nto point1 :r \nrt 90 fd :r/20\nbk :r/20 lt 90\nend\n\n;-------------\n\nto arc2 :r \npu setxy 0 0 lt 90 fd :r rt 90 pd\nrepeat 30 [fd :r*pi/180 rt 1]\nend\n\n;--------------\nto point :r\nrt 90 fd :r/10\nbk :r/10 lt 90\nend\n\n;------------\n\nto hour_hand :r\nlt 90 fd :r rt 90 fd 55 \nrt 90 fd 2*:r rt 90 fd 55 rt 90 fd :r rt 90\nif :r<0.5 [stop] hour_hand :r-0.5\nend\n\n\n;----------\n\nto minute_hand :r\nlt 90 fd :r  rt 90 fd 75 rt 90 fd 2*:r\nrt 90 fd 75 rt 90 fd :r rt 90\nif :r< 0.5 [stop] minute_hand :r-0.5\nend\n\n;----------\n\nto red\nsetpencolor [255 0 0]\nEND\n\nto black\nsetpencolor [0 0 0]\nend\n\nto blue\nsetpencolor [0 0 255]\nend\n\n\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":" \n\t\t\tCLOCK OUT OF TUNE\n\t         **************************\n\n    TASK 1\n....................................\n1. Run the command \"clock 120 1 50 -5\".\n\n   •    What do you notice;  \n\nActivate the variation tool and explore their role on the procedure.\n \n   •    What time did you expect to see on the clock for these specific values of the variables? \n   •    What time do you see?  \n\nTry more different values. \n\n   •    What do you notice about the out of tune problem? Does the clock go forward or back? \n   •    Which variable is responsible and what is its relation with the other ones? \n\n2. How is the variable :x related to the variables :h and :m?\n\n    Set the value range of the variable :x from -10 to 60 and set the step value to 0.5.\nKeep the variables h (hour) and m (minute) stable and explore the way the hour hand changes while the variable :x is changing.\nOnce you find the right hour, check the relation of the variable :x with the variables :m and :h. Try more values.\n\nCompose a conjecture on this relation (between :x and :m,:h).\n\n\nTASK 2\n...............................\n1. Go to the variation tool. Click on the horizontal axis Ox for the variable :m and on the vertical axis Oy for the variable :x in order to activate the 2D variation tool. Try to identify the relation between the variable :x and the variable :m, while preserving the right hour. \n\n   •    What kind of shape is the graph that shows their relation?\n   •    What is your conclusion based on the graph and the relation between the two variables?\n\n2. Correct the code in order to fix the clock.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  --------------\n\t\t\t\t\t        TIP\n\t\t\t\t\t......................\n1. The moving of the hour hand depends on the moving of the minute hand. As a result, every time its final position shows both the hour passed and the fraction of minutes passed, when the minute hand moved. \nFor example, when the time is 01:20, the hour hand does not point on the exact dial of \"1\" but it points a bit to the right.\n\n   •    How much does it move on the right every time the minute hand moves?\n\n2. The quantities :x and :m are proportional and connected with each other with the expression:\n                                             :x=:m/2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
