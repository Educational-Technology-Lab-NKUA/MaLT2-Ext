The procedures \"square\" and \"rectangle\" are embodied in the procedure \"mystery\". Define and run the above procedures by yourself. At the procedure \"mystery\", explore the constructed shapes. \n\n   •    What kind of shape is the one formed by the 4 rectangles inside the big square? \n   •    Can you find its side length?\n\n2.  Change the length of the rectangles sides from 30-70 to 40-80 and then to 20-80.\n\n    •    What happens at each case?\n\n3. Try to enable the variation tool (by clicking on the trace)\n\n   •    Did you make it? Why?  \n\n     Change the values from 20 - 80 (for the rectangles) and 100 (for the external square) in a way that the final shape would be the same, but it could be possible to take (as input) many different values.\n\n   •    What should you use instead of these specific values?\n    Name this new procedure as \"dynamic_shape\".\n\nTask 2\n...............................\n1. Complete the procedure \"dynamic_shape\", so that it would print the perimeter of the internal square, formed by the 4 equal rectangles in any case. \n\n    •   Can you come to a conclusion about the use of the variables? \n\t\t\t\t---------------\n\t\t\t\t     TIPS\n\t\t\t\t----------------\nTask 1\n..................................\n   Use variables instead of the specific values of sides. For instance, you can name :a and :b or :x and :y. \n   •    Can you think why this is the right way?\n\nTask 2\n................................\n   For the perimeter of the internal square you must use the function \"absolute value\" (command: abs) in front of the perimeter formula.   \n \n     •    Why? What kind of values the perimeter cannot take?\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
