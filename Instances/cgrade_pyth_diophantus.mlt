This procedure constructs a rectangle that consists of many small equal rectangles, as well as a double \"measure tape\" that can be used to compute the length and the width of the small or the bigger rectangles.\n\nTASK 1\nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's trace) and set the limit values (of the variables m and n) from 0 to 10. Using the measure tape (through the variable a), try to find the size (length and width) i) of the small rectangles and ii)of the bigger one, for various values of the variables m and n.\n\nComplete the following expressions:\na) when m=10 and n=6 :\nlength of the small rectangle  =\nwidth of the small rectangle  =\nlength of the big rectangle  =\nwidth of the big rectangle  =\n\nb) when m=12 and n=5\nlength of the small rectangle  =\nwidth of the small rectangle  =\nlength of the big rectangle  =\nwidth of the big rectangle  =\n\nc) Repeat the steps a), b) for more different values of m and n. Explore the relation between the sides of the small rectangles and the sides of the big one, in respect to the variables m and n.\n\nWhen m=      , n=      :\nlength of the small rectangle  =\nwidth of the small rectangle  =\nlength of the big rectangle  =\nwidth of the big rectangle  =\n\nTry to express the area of a small rectangle and the area of the big one, using the variables m and n : \n\nArea.small.rectangle  =\nArea.big.rectangle =\n\nTASK 2\nRun the command \"grid 10 6\" that constructs four rectangles; each rectangle equals the rectangle appeared before, when running the procedure \"rectangle2\". These four rectangles form two squares. \n\nTry to discover:\ni) The size of the two squares' sides and their areas, in respect to the variables m and n.\n\nArea.big.square=\nArea.small.square=\n\nii) Is there a square of the same area as the one of the 4 rectangles together? \nTry to find the length of its side and its area:\n\nSide of the new square = \nArea of the new square =\n\niii) Complete the relation among the three squares, in respect of the variables m and n :\n\n................ = ...........   + ................\n\nCan you prove this relation algebraically?\nWhat is your conclusion? \n\n\n\n\n\nΥπόδειξη:\nΓια τους θετικούς και άνισους ακέραιους αριθμούς μ, ν \nΙσχύει  (μ^2+ν^2)^2 =(μ^2-ν^2)^2 +4 μ^2 ν^2  (γιατί;)\nΟι αριθμοί  μ^2+ν^2 , μ^2-ν^2, και 2 μ ν  σχηματίζουν πάντα μία Πυθαγόρεια τριάδα.\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
