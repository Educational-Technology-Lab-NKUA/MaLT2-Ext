Define and run the procedure \"area 100 60\". \nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the trace of the avatar) and investigate the role of the variables :a and :b.\n\n 2. What kind of shape is the one formed among the 4 rectangles? Does it remain the same kind while changing the values of the variables? \nCompose a conjecture and test it.\n    Set the value range for the variable :b from 0 to 100, when :a=200 (fixed value). \n \n   •    What does the avatar construct when :b=0 and :b=100? \n\n   Try more different values for the two variables and compute the length of the sides of the internal shape. \n\nTask 2 \n...............................\n1. Sara claims that the area of the internal square can be found by the formula: \n  :a*:a - 4*(:a -:b)*:b, \nwhile Ebba claims that the right formula is:\n  (:a-2*:b)*(:a-2*:b). \n\n   •    Can you find a formula for computing the area by yourself? \n\n  Write this formula at the bottom line of the procedure \"area\" and print the result by using the command \"print\". \nThen try the same with the two formulas that Sara and Ebba found.  \n\n    •    What is the value of the area of the square at each case?\n    •    Which one of them is right?\n\n2.
