Write it down to your notebook: \n       If........................ then the rectangles' sides are of the same length for any x. \n    • Can you change the procedure \"riddle\" in order for it to always construct two rectangles of the same size? \n\n3) When the rectangles' sides are of the same length, they form together another bigger rectangle. \n\n    •  Can you write the three mononyms that express the area for each one of the three rectangles constructed?\n      \n                     area.rect1=30x^n\n                     area.rect2=\n                     area.rect1,2=\n       (Try to use variables x,n and k for the expressions)\n    • Can you find an algebraic relation that connects these three mononyms with each other?\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n-----------------\n2) When n=k\nthen the sharing side (of the two rectangles) is expressed by the mononym x^n. \nIf the values of the variables n and k weren't equal, the mononyms x^n and x^k would't be similar and their values would differ for various values of the variable x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
