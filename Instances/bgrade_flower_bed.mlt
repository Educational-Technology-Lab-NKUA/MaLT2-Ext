Adam tried to make the procedure \"flower_bed\" in order to compute accurately the size of the flower bed. But he faced a difficulty. Can you help him fix the procedure?\r\n\r\n;----------------        \r\n;----------------\r\n;For further instructions click on the papyrus button.\r\n;----------------        \r\n;----------------\r\n;Procedures\r\n;.............\r\nto circle :a\r\nrepeat 360 [fd :a rt 1]\r\nend\r\n\r\n;-----------\r\nTO flower_bed :a :r\r\nblack\r\ncircle :a\r\ngreen\r\nsquare :r\r\nend\r\n\r\nclean\r\nflower_bed 1 36\r\n;-------------\r\nto square :r \r\nrt 45\r\nrepeat 4 [fd :r*sqrt(2) rt 90]\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\nclean\r\nsquare 55\r\n\r\nto black \r\nsetpencolor [0 0 0]\r\nend\r\n\r\nto green\r\nsetpencolor [0 255 0]\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":" \n\t             Planting Flowers\n\t\t\t                                                                         ******************************\n   TASK 1\n...............................\n1. Run the procedure \"circle\". Compose a conjecture on the role of the variable :a in the procedure \"circle\" and test it. Activate the variation tool and try different values of the variable :a.\n\n   •    In what way does the avatar construct the circle?\n   •    What is the difference between that way and the way you would construct it on paper using caliper?\n\n2. Run the procedure \"flower_bed\". Explore the way the avatar constructs the square.\n\nTASK 2\n...................................\n1. Now go to the variation tool. Click on the horizontal  axis Ox for the variable :a and on the vertical axis Oy for the variable :r in order to activate the 2D variation tool.\nTry to understand the relation between the variable :a and the variable :r, while preserving the edges of the square on the inside of the circumference. Then draw the graph that expresses their relation.\n\n   •    What is the shape of this graph?\n   •    What is your conclusion based on the graph and the relation between the two variables? \n   •    Can you describe this relation?\n\n2. Fix the procedure in order to always construct a square inside a circle. \n3. Replace with the relation you ended up with on Question 2 in order for the avatar to construct a square, using the minimum needed number of variables (only the variable :a).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                 -------------------\n\t\t\t                        TIPS\n\t\t\t                -------------------\nTASK 2\n.................................\n1.
