{"editorCode":";\tEnlarge a rectangle\n\n;Teacher asked 1st grade students to write a procedure that draws two rectangles. The 1st rectangle with dimensions 50,100 and the 2nd with dimensions  :a and :m \n\n;One rectangle should be within the other. The process should print the ratio of the dimensions of the two rectangles. \n \n;Kiki wrote the process \"rectangle\", defined it and executed as \"rectangle 150 200\".
