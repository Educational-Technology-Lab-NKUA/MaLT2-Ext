{"editorCode":";     Triangles inside a semicircle\n\n\n;Noah claims that his procedure \"triang_semicir\" constructs right angled triangles that has their one edge moving on a semicircle. The triangle has sides of length :a, :b and :c (:c is also the diameter of the semicircle) and all of them depend on the radius of the semicircle. In order to verify his construction, Noah also made the procedure \"squares\" that constructs 3 squares outside the triangle and their sides equal to each one of the triangle side. But there is a problem that he can't identify. Can you help him find it and fix it? \n\n;For further instructions click on the papyrus button.\n;----------------      \n\n;Procedures\n;-------------\n;Task 1\n;..............\nclean\ntriang_semicir 120 10\n\n;Task 2\n;................\nto squares :r :x :n\ntriang_semicir :r :x\nlt 90-:x green\nrepeat :n[fd 2*:r*cos(90-:x) rt 90]\nrt 180\nrepeat :n[fd  2*:r*sin(90-:x) rt 90]\nlt 90+:x red\nrepeat :n[fd 2*:r rt 90]\nend\n\n\nclean\nsquares 80 49 4\n\n;Task 3\n;............... \nto alg_check... ... \ncheck ... ... \nprint........\nprint.........\nprint.........\nprint...........\nend\n\nclean\nalg_check ... ...\n\n;=======================\n;======================\nTo triang_semicir :r :x \nsemicircle :r\ntriangles :r :x\nend\n\n\n;----------------------\nto semicircle :r\nblack\nstarting_point\nrepeat 180 [rt 1 fd pi*:r/180]\nrt 90 fd 2*:r\nend\n\n;----------------------\nTO triangles :r :x\nblue\nrt 90+:x fd 2*:r*cos(90-:x)\nrt 90 fd 2*:r*sin(90-:x)\nrt 180-:x pu fd 2*:r pd rt 90\nend\n\n;------------------\nto red  \nsetpencolor [255 0 0]\nend\nto blue \nsetpencolor[0 0 255]\nend\nto green\nsetpencolor [0 255 0]\nend\nto black \nsetpencolor[0 0 0]\nend\n\nTO starting_point\npu setxy -120 0 pd\nend\n\n\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":"\t\t\t    Triangles inside a semicircle\n\t\t\t***************************\n\nTASK 1\n..............................\n1.
