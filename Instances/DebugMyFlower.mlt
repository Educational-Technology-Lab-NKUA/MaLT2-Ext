You can do that by making some changes to the procedure \"buggyFlower\".\n\nCan you fix it (make it a closed symmetrical pattern) for every value of its variables?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion: Maybe you only use two variables; one for the length of its petals and one for the angle between each two petals.\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
