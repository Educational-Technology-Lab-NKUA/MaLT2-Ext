You can count them yourself.\n\nIf you run again the same command, you'll see that these 5 points changed spot and , possibly, the number of red points also may changed.\n\nWhat happened exactly?\nThe command \"experiment 5\" makes the avatar choose randomly 5 spots at the interior of the square and design points. It is in fact a random experiment.\n\n\n\nTASK 1\n----------------------------\nLet's start with a simpler experiment by running the command \"experiment 1\". Then only one point is designed in the square area. \n\nHow would you define the possibility \"the random point is in the circle area\"?\n\nYou shall work according to this:\nCount how many times the point was in the circle area (and thus colored red) for n repetitions of the \"experiment 1\".\n\nSimilarly, you could design n random points in the square area and count how many of them are in the circle area (thus colored red). This can be done by the procedure \"experiment n\".\n\nLet's start with a series of experiments:\n\n1) Run the command \"experiment 4\"\n     Number of red points = \n    (Number of red points) / (Number of black points) = \n\n2) Run the command \"experiment 40\" \n     Number of red points = \n  We multiplied by 10 the total number of points. Test if the red points were also multiplied by 10 (approximately).\n    (Number of red points) / (Number of black points) = \n \n3) Run the command \"experiment 400\"\n     Number of red points = \nWe again multiplied by 10 the total number of points. Test if the red points were also multiplied by 10 (approximately).\n    (Number of red points) / (Number of black points) = \n    \n4) Run the command \"super_experiment\"\n    Number of red points (add up all the red points appeared at the Editor's output area) = \nWe again multiplied by 10 the total number of points. Test if the red points were also multiplied by 10 (approximately).\n    (Number of red points) / (Number of black points) = \n\n\n\nTASK 2\n----------------------------\nHave you noticed that the more higher the number n is, the more the ratio\n         (Number of red points) / (Number of black points) \napproximates a specific number?\nWhich number is this?\n\n(Tip: you may recognize the 4-multiple of this number)\n\nIt is now logical to define this limit number as the possibility \"the random point is in the circle area\" for the random experiment where we design a random point in the square area.\n\na) What is the relation between this limit number with the area of the two shapes (of the circular disc and the square)? \n\nb) In conclusion, how can this possibility of the case \"the random point is in the circle area\" be defined geometrically? \n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
