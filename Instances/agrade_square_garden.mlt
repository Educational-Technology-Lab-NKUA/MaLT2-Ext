So there are 4*8 slabs for all sides and 4 more slabs at the corners. In total 32_4=36 slabs. \nc) If :n is the number of slabs at each side of the square garden, then the total number of slabs is \n4*:n+4 ή 4(:n+1).\nd) Solve the equation 4*:n+4=88 to find :n\ne)  Solve the equation  4*:n+4=51 to find :n. Can a natural number be the solution of this equation  ? \nConsider the part 4(:n+1) which is the number of the slabs. The number of the slabs is always multiple of which number? \n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
