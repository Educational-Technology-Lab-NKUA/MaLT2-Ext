A broken line with two horizontal and two vertical segments (a broken rectangle) is constructed.\n\nTASK 1:\nActivate the variation tool and set the value range of each variable from 0 to 12.\nStarting from setting a=b=0, change one variable each time in order to notice how the sides of the broken rectangle depend on them.\nTry to close the broken line and form a rectangle.
