Define and run the procedure \"riddle\". Enable the sliders of the variation tool (by clicking on the trace of the avatar) and investigate the role of the variables :a and :b.\n\n 2. What kind is the shape formed among the 4 rectangles?\n  Compose a statement.  \n  For the variable :b set the value range from 0 to 100, when :a=200. \n\n   •    What happens when the variable :b takes the minimum and the maximum value?\n   •    What happens when the value of :b becomes half the value of :a? Test if this observation works in other cases of initial values for variable :a.\n\nTask 2\n............................\n  Ellie claims that the area of the internal square (formed among the four rectangles) is:\n                             :α*:α-:α*:β\n\n   •    Do you agree;\n\n   Compute the area of the internal square by yourself. Then complete the bottom row of the procedure \"riddle\" by writing the formula for the computation of the area that you used, using the command \"print\". \n\n   •    What is the area of the square value? \n\n\t\t\t\t------------------\n\t\t\t\t         TIPS\n\t\t\t\t-----------------\nTask 2\n................................\n   Consider how the internal square is formed by the stable external one. \n\n* Every time you run the command \"print\" , a message appears at the bottom of the area of the Editor.
