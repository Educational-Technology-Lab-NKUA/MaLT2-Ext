{"editorCode":";\tEnlarge and shrink a triangle\n\n;Chris wrote the procedure \"right_triangle\". When he runs the procedure as  \"right_triangle 60 100\" it draws a right triangle\n\n;Now he wants to create another right triangle, an enargement of the first, with side :ΑΒ=120. He runs the procedure as \"right_triangle 120 80 200\" but it didn't designed the triangle he wanted.  \n\n;Help Chris to fix the procedure so that the bird draws the triangle he wants\n\n;Click the papyrus on the left to read detailed instructions\n\n;--------PROCEUDRES---------------\n\nTo right_triangle :AB :BC :CA\nlt 90 fd :AB\nrt 90 fd :BC\nrt 126.87 fd :CA \nlt (180-53.13) \nend\ncs\nright_triangle 80 60 100\nright_triangle 120 80 200\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":8.124557076671068e-15,"z":132.68408625781248},"character":"Bird","notes":"Instructions\n-------------------------------------------------\na) Define the procedure right_triangle and run it with the two set of numbers to see what Chris has constructed.\n\nTo define the procedure, select the lines from the word \"TO\" to the word \"END\" and then press the \"Insert\" button on your keyboard or the \"Run Code\" (Play) button on the right top of the editor. \n\nTo run the procedure, click on the line \"right_triangle 80 60 100\"and then press the \"Insert\" button on your keyboard or the \"Run Code\" (Play) button on the right top of the editor. \nSimilarly, click on the line \"right_triangle 80 60 100\"\nand press the  \"Insert\" button or the \"Run Code\" button.\n\nb) Can you find the correct values to run the procedure so that it draws the triangle that Christos wants?\n\nc) Can you find the correct values to run the procedure so that it draws a triangle  with :BC=45 which would be a shrinking of the first triangle.\n\n Answers\n--------------------------------------------\n(b) The enlargement ratio is 120/80 = 1,5. Knowing that the other sides of the 1st triangle are 60 and 100, calculate the size of the sides of the 2nd triangle with enlargement ratio 1,5. \n\n(c) The shrinking ration is  45/60 = 0,75. Knowing that the other sides of the 1st triangle are 60 and 100, calculate the size of the sides of the 2nd triangle with shrinking ratio 0,75. \n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
