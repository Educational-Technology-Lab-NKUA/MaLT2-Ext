Activate the variation tool and explore: \n\n   •    In what way does the title of this activity connect to the avatar's construction? \n\n  Change the value range of each variable in order for the inside pink square to always stay inside the external black one.\n\nTASK 2\n................................\n  Alicia wants to compute the area of the pink square (by using the Pythagorean Theorem) and print it on the screen in every moment of its \"dancing\" inside the black square. Thus, she made the procedure \"area_calc\", but she wasn't sure if it gives the correct result. \n\n   •    Can you help her verify if it is right or not and then, if not, fix the code?\n\n\t\t\t\t--------------------\n\t\t\t\t       TIPS\n\t\t\t\t-------------------\nTASK 1\n................................\n The value range of the variable :b should be from 0 to :a.\n\nTASK 2\n...............................\n Some questions you should consider in order to give the right answer:\n   •    If we remove the pink \"dancing\" square from the black stable one, what kind of figures are the ones that remain inside this black square?\n   •    What is the relation between them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
