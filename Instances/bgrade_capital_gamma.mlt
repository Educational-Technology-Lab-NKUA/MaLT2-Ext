Check these values in order to see it yourself.\nStudy the writing of the procedure \"capital_gamma\" that constructed it. Then try to change the commands of the procedure in order to make the letter gamma change its size (the length of its segments) but always preserve its shape, its proportions and thus its beauty.\n\nComplete properly the procedure \"capital_gamma2\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\nThe construction of the changing-size-Gamma (Γ) will depend on only one variable. Why is that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
