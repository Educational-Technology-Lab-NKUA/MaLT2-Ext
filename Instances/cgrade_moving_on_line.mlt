The procedure \"point\" places a point whose co-ordinates are determined by the commander. The procedure \"line\" constructs a straight line.\n\n\nIf a point moves on a straight line, what is the relation between its coordinates? \n\n\nTASK\n--------------------------\nRun the following commands:\n\nclean\naxes\nline\npoint 3 2\n\na) Activate the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's light blue trace) for the procedure \"point\" and set the value range of the variables x and y from -9 to 9. \n     Try to move the point on the straight line by changing the values of the variable y. \n     Repeat the same for different values of x.\n\nb) When the point is on the line, what is the relation between x and y? \n     You can complete the following table at your notebook for help:\n             x ||   -4  |   -2   |   0   |   1   |   3   |   \n           --------------------------------------------\n            y  ||         |          |        |        |         |\n   \n     Write down the relation that you concluded to: \n                                 y=\n\nc) Lastly, complete the gap ... in the procedure \"path\" in order to limit the movement of the point to be only on the straight line (while the variable x changes values).\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
