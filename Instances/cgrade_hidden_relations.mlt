Two red squares are constructed; one of them has stable side length while the other one has side length a. \nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's trace) and set the limit values of the variable a from 0 to 100. Can you find the length of the side of the small square?\n \n          big square's side = a\n          small square's side = ....\n\nTASK 1\nRun the command \"thesquares 100\". Two red squares are again constructed (the same as before), but now a third green square is also constructed. \nEnable the variation tool and set the limit values of the variable a from 0 to 100.\nCan you find the relation between the length of the side of the green square and the variable a?\n\n                    green square's side = ...\n\n(You can use the small red square's side length as a comparing measure.)\n\nCan you find the area of each square? \n              area of small red square = ........\n              area of big red square = ........\n              area of green square = ........\n\nTASK 2\nRun the procedure \"thesquares2 100 0\" . Once again the two red squares and the green one are constructed. Enable the variation tool and set the limit values of the two variables from 0 to 100. Try many different values for the variable \"move\" in order to understand the way it affects the shapes.\n\nTry to complete the below relation: (try various values for the variable a) :\n\n                   (α-30)^2  ...  α^2 - 30^2  \n(complete it using =, <, or >) \n\nTry to complete the following expression of the area of the green square:\n\n        (α-30)^2 = ... \n\n\nTASK 3\nExplore the procedures of the construction of the squares and create a new one, called \"squares3\" and \"thesquares3\", using the variables a, b(=the side of the small red square) and move. \nTest the generality of the relations that you found previously.\n\nTry to complete the following expressions: \n\n(a-b)^2   ...  a^2 - b^2      (complete with <, >, or =)\n(a - b)^2  = ...
