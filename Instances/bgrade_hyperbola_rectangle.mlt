A square and a rectangle with two red vertical and two black horizontal sides are constructed.\n\nActivate the variation tool in order to find the relation between the sides of each shape and the variables a, x and y.\nSet the value range for each variable from 1 to 100.\n\nComplete the following expressions:\nsquare side = ...\nblack rectangle side=...\nred rectangle side= ...\n\nTASK 1\ni)   When a=20, can you find the right values for the variables x and y in order for the rectangle to be equal to the square (be of the exact same shape)?\nx=\ny=\n\nii)    When a=20,  can you find the right values for the variable y in order for the rectangle to be equivalent to the square (have the same area), when the variable x takes the following values:\n\nwhen x= 5        y= ...\n        x=10        y=...\n        x=16        y=...\n        x=20        y=...\n        x=40        y=...\n        x= 100     y= ...\n\nCan you describe the amounts x and y?

Click on the horizontal axis for the variable x and the vertical axis for the variable y, in order to activate the 2D variation tool.\nClick on the check points button and then click on the area of the 2D system of co-ordinates. A point appears there. Drag it to the position where its coordinates is the 1st pair of values that you found on TASK 1 ii) :        (5,....).\n\nRepeat the same, by adding new control points and move them to the position where its coordinates are the pairs of values found on TASK 1 ii):                   (10, ...)

Why? \n\nCan you add a new point and move it to a position that satisfies the preconditions of TASK 1 ii) (for the rectangle to be equivalent to the square) without computing its coordinates beforehand?\n\n\nTASK 3\nModify the procedure \"double\" in order to always construct a rectangle equivalent to the square of side length 20. Complete or correct the procedure \"double2\" properly and then test it by running the command \"double2 50\".\n\n\nTASK 4\nModify the procedure \"double2\" in order to always construct a rectangle equivalent to a square of side length a. \nComplete or correct the procedure \"double3\" and  then test it by running the command \"double3 20 50\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
