A triangle of fixed size is constructed. Study the procedure \"triangle\" in order to see the length of its sides and the measure of its angles.\nNote them on a paper and name its elements.\n\nTASK 1\nCan you complete the procedure \"small_triangle\" in order to make a similar triangle of ratio 1:2?\n\nTASK 2\nRun the command \"triangles_together 80\" and activate the variation tool. Set the value range of the variable k starting from 0.\nChange the values of the variable k and notice hoe it affects the shape.\nWhen k=0, what is the position and the relation between the 2 triangles?\nWhat is the relation between the 2 red segments\nCan you compose a general rule about it?\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
