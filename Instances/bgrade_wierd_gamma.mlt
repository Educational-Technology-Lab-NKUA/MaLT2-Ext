The Greek capital letter gamma (Γ) is constructed. \n\nTASK 1\nStudy the procedure \"gamma\". Activate the variation tool and set the value range of the variable a from 0 to 100.\nTry to find out the relation between the height and the width (of letter Γ) and the variable a. Complete the following expressions: \nheight= ...\nwidth= ....\nAre the height and the width proportional quantities? Why/why not?\n\nCan you find the perimeter of letter Γ? \nP= ...\nAre the quantities a and P proportional? \n\nTASK 2\nRun the command \"gamma2 60 170\". \nActivate the variation tool. Click on the horizontal axis for the variable a and the vertical axis for the variable P, in order to activate the 2D variation tool.\nA point appears at the orthonormal system of co-ordinates of the 2D variation tool (click on the check points button and then click on the area of the system of co-ordinates). \nDrag the point on that area and notice the way the values of the variables a and P -as well as the shape of the letter Γ- change.\nCalculate the perimeter of the letter gamma when a=100 by using your control point and its coordinates printed on the (1D) variation tool. \nRepeat the same with other control points when a=50 , a=30 , a=20, a=10,  a=0.\nWhere do all these points lay on? Can you find the relation between the coordinates of these points?\n\nP = ...\n\nDoes this reminds you of a specific function? \nWhat is the formula of this function on a Cartesian system of co-ordinates x-y? (Let the values of the variable a correspond to the horizontal axis x and the ones of the variable P to the vertical axis y)\n\nComplete the following expression:\ny= ...\n\nWhat is the shape of the graph of that function?\nCan you find its y-intersect?\nWhat is the relation between the y-intersect and the shape of the letter gamma designed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
