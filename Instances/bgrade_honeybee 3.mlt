Can you predict what kind of shape the avatar would construct without running the procedure \"mystery\"? \n\n\n2.Olivia wanted to construct any regular polygon, not only the regular hexagon. That is why she wrote the procedure \"regular_polygon\" using variables. But when she ran it, she realized that there was a mistake. \n\n   •    Can you help her fix the procedure?\n\nEnable the sliders of the variation tool and explore the shape for different values of each variable. \nCompose a statement. \nTest if your idea is able to fix the procedure. \n\n3. Can you write the procedure that Olivia though, but this time using only two variables? (instead of three) \n\nTask 2\n.....................................\n The teacher gave them the procedure \"bee\", where the avatar constructs a honeycomb, whose cells are regular hexagons. She told them that the procedure has a problem that they had to identify and repair. Can you help them? \n\t\t\t\t-----------------\n\t\t\t\t       TIPS\n\t\t\t\t------------------\nTask 1\n................................\n1.
