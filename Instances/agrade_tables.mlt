{"editorCode":";   How many tables for 34 students?\n\n;The 1st grade students wrote the procedure \"tables_arrangement\" (which executes the subprocedure \"square\"), in order to draw diverse arrangements of tables for the meeting room. On every side of the table can be placed one chair for one student to sit. How many tables should they use if there are 34 students to sit?  \n\n;Click the papyrus on the left to read the activity instructions.\n\n;---------------- PROCEDURES ------------\n\nTo square :a\nrepeat 4[fd :a rt 90]\nend\n\nTo tables_arrangement :n :a\nrepeat :n[square :a \nrt 90 fd :a lt 90]\nend\ncs\ntables_arrangement 16 15\n\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":" Instructions\n-----------\na) Define the two procedures and execute: \n«tables_arrangement  6 40».\nWhat is the role of each parameter?\nTo define the procedure select the lines from the word \"TO\" to the word \"END\" and press the button \"Insert\" on your keyboard or the button \"Run Code\" on the left corner of the editor. \n\nTo execute the procedure, click on the line with «tables_arrangement 16 15» and press the \n«insert» [INS] button on your keyboard or the button \"Run Code\" on the editor.\nClick on the trace in the scene to activate the \"sliders\" tool.
