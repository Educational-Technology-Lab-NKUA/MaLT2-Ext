His goal was to make a letter Γ whose size could be changed while its proportions would be preserved (the same way as they were on the paper). \nLucas noticed that even though the first shape was similar to the one drawn on the paper, when changing its size, it wasn't preserving the same shape and it wasn't reminding of the letter Γ. You can see it yourself by activating the variation tool and changing the value of the variable a.\n\nActivate the variation tool and set the value range of the variable a from 10 to 200. Change the size of the letter Γ \n in order to see if and when it does preserving its proportions. (E.g. notice its shape when a=200).\n\nStudy the procedure \"capital_gamma\" and fix Noah's mistakes. Complete or rewrite the procedure \"capital_gamma2\" on the Editor and run the command \"capital_gamma2 30\" to verify your corrections.\nActivate the variation tool, change the values of the variable a and notice the way it changes its size.\n\n\nTASK 2\nCan you find the perimeter P of the letter Γ made by the procedure \"capital_gamma2\" that you wrote? \nComplete the expressions in your notebook:\n\na) when its height equals a?\nHeight= a         width= ...
