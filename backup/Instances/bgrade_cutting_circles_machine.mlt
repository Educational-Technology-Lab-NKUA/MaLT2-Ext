Run the command \"cut 10  20 10 14\" and try to discover the role of each variable at the procedure. Can you explain where the problem of the productive procedure  of circular sheet metal is? \n\n2. Investigate how the machine cuts the sheets of metal. Correct the procedure in order for the circular sheets to not cover each other and ruin the production.\n\n   •   On what thing does the amount of cutting circular sheets depend on? \n   •    Can you make an estimation on how many circular sheets would be cut for any value the variables would take? \n\n Explore different values for each variable, using the variation tool.\n\n    •   What is printed at the bottom area of the Editor?\n    •   What part of the surface remains after the cut of the circular sheets each time?\n\n Try to locate the mistake and fix the procedure.\n\t\t\t\t-------------------\n\t\t\t\t    TIP\n\t\t\t\t--------------------\n1. Find the value of the variable :n for which the problem is fixed and replace it to the procedure. Then correct the rest of the procedures.\n2.
