A rectangle that consists of two black and two red sides is constructed. \n\nTASK 1\n\nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's trace) and set the value range of the variable x from 0 to 50.\nTry many different values of x and observe the changes on the rectangle. \na) Find the value of the variable x for which the red sides of the rectangle are eliminated (their length = 0). \nWrite it down:\nx= ...\n\nb) Find the value of the variable x for which the black sides of the rectangle are eliminated.\nWrite it down:\nx =...\n\nc) Can you find the area of the rectangle for each one of these two cases (a and b)?\nWrite it down:\nA= ...\n\nTASK 2\nStudy the procedure \"rectangle\" carefully in order to find the relation between the rectangle's sides and the variable x. Express these relations for each side using the variable x:\n\nred side = ...\nblack side = ...\nNow, can you explain algebraically the values of the variable x that you found at TASK 1a,b? \n\nTASK 3\nTry to find the relation between the rectangle and the equation: \n(2x-30) (3x-150) = 0\n\nModify the procedure \"rectangle2\" in order to construct a rectangle whose sides are eliminated when x=12 or x=30.\n\n\n\n\nTIPS\nTASK 2:\nWhen you run the command \"fd 2*x-30\" and the value of 2x-30 is negative, the avatar goes backwards by |2x-30| units. In that case, what is the length of the vertical side of the rectangle in relation to the variable x?\n\nTASK 3:\nTake into account the following points:\n1. The formula that gives the area of a rectangle \n2. |χ|=0 if and only if x=0\n    \n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
