{"editorCode":";         Puzzle of rectangles\n\n;Albi decided to make a puzzle using rectangles. Thus he took 4 rectangles with sides of length: \n;the first one: axa\n;the second one: bxb\n; and the other two: axb\n;He wanted to connect them side by side in order to make a square. You can see his first attempt at the procedure \"square\".   \n\n;Even though the constructed shape isn't the desirable one, the idea behind it is far from wrong. It is possible for the procedure and its sub-procedure to construct a square! Can you discover how? You' re gonna have to make some changes in the procedure \"square\".  \n\n;For further instructions click on the papyrus button.\n\n\nTO rectangle :a :b \nrepeat 2 [fd :a rt 90 fd :b rt 90]\nend\n\nclean\nrectangle 30 50\nrectangle 50 30\nrectangle 30 30\n\n   \nTo square :a :b\nrectangle :a :a\nrt 90\nrectangle :a :b\nrt 90 \nrectangle :a :b\nrt 90\nrectangle :b :b\nrt 90\nend\n\nclean\nsquare 30 50\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                   Puzzle of rectangles                            :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n  INTRODUCTION\n----------------\nStudy the procedure \"rectangle\" carefully. \na) What does the command \"rectangle 30 30\" construct?\nb) What is the relation between the two rectangles which are constructed by running the commands \"rectangle 30 50\" and \"rectangle 50 30\"?\n\n    TASK\n----------------------------\na) Try to modify the procedure \"square\" in order for the constructed external shape -which consists of the 4 rectangles, with the predefined side lengths- to always form a square, for any value of the variables a and b.\n  \nb) Can you write a formula to express the external square's side, using the variables a and b?\nUse it to complete the following expression of that square's area:\n    \n                           A = side^2 = (...)^2\n\nc) The square constructed by the procedure \"square\" contains smaller rectangles and squares, whose areas can be expressed using the variables a and b. Combine this with your answer at b) and formulate an identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
