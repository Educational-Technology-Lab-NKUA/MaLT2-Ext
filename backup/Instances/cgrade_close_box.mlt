{"editorCode":"       ;Close the box!\n\n;William wrote a procedure that creates a box and he tries to \"close\" its top. He achieved that but only for some values of the variables a and b. He was wondering what is the relation between the two variables when the box is closed and realized that they are the solutions of a two-variable equation. \n;He is trying to come up with more solutions without having to do calculations by hand.

An open box, i.e. a broken line that consists of one red and four black segments.  \n\nTASK 1:\nActivate the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's trace) and set the value range of the variables a and b from -5 to 20. \nStudy the way the segments of the broken line depend (or not) on the variables a and b.\nTry to \"close\" the broken line into a rectangle, in order to \"close\" the box. \n\nFind the values of the variables a,b for which the box is closed. Write it down:\n\na= ...               b= ...\n\nAre these values the only ones for which the box is closed? If you found more than one case, write it down in your textbook.\n\nTASK 2:\nStudy the procedure \"box\" that constructed the broken line and try to explain your answers at TASK 1 algebraically.\n\nTASK 3:\nGo to the variation tool and click on the horizontal axis for the variable a and the vertical one for the variable b in order to activate the 2D variation tool. On the 2D variation tool you can create a checkpoint (a red point) and by dragging them, the values of the variables a and b change. This causes changes on the length of the segments of the broken line.\nMove the red point to the spot (a,b) that you found at TASK 1.\nRepeat the same with other pairs of values of a and b that \"close\" the box and drag the red point to that spot.\nYou can use the following values for a:\n(Write them down)\na=3    b=;\na=0,   b=;\na=6,   b=;\n\nCan you find out where these points are lying on? What is the formula of the function whose graph passes through these points? \n(Write the formula down)\ny= ....\n\nCan you find its y-intersect? (Namely K)\nK = ( ....   ,  .....)\n\nDescribe a Enable the variation tool a strategy according to which you can find more values for a and b that \"close\" the box, without making any other calculations.\n\\\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
