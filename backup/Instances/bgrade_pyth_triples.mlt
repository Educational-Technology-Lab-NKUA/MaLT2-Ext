Define and run the procedure \"triangle 20 50 15\". Enable the sliders of the variation tool (by clicking on the trace of the avatar) and investigate the role of the variables :a, :b and :c. \n\nTest different values for the triple :a, :b and :c. \n\n  •    Which one of them corresponds to the hypotenuses of the right triangle?\n\n   •    Can you find a number triple that corresponds to the values of the length of the sides of a right triangle? \n\n2.

Charlie claims that if you find a number triple that corresponds to the sides of a right triangle, then you can find an infinite number of triples. \n\n   •    Do you agree?\n\nExplore your thoughts by using the variation tool of each variable. \n\n2.

How can the three squares be useful? \n   •    What theorem can you apply in order to test whether the triangle is right?\n\n    A Pythagorean triple is a number triple with each number corresponding to the length of a side of a right triangle. For example (:a, :b, :c) = (30, 40, 50).\n\nTask 2\n................................\n 1. \nIf (:a, :b, :c) is a Pythagorean triple, then all of its multiples is also a Pythagorean triple. \n\n    •    Can you write a formula that always gives Pythagorean triples and constructs a right triangle (using the tree squares)? \n\n2.\nTO p_triple :a :b :c :t :k\nsquare3 :k*:c\nfd  :k*:c\nrt :t\nfd :k*:a\nsquare1 :k*:a\nrt 90\nfd :k*:b\nsquare2 :k*:b\nEND\n\ncleartext\np_triple 30 40 50 45  2\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
