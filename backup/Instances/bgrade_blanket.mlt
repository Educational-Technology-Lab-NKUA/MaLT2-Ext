{"editorCode":"\n;\t    Designing a blanket\n\n;Ella wants to make a colorful blanket, whose design would be overlaid rectangles. These rectangles have sides of length that is multiple of an initial length :a and :b, so  that each rectangle would be a enlargement of the previous one and ,at the same time,a diminishing of the next one. That way, the final shape would be characterized by a uniformity. Thus, Ella made the procedure \"design\" in order to see what the final picture of the design she though about was like.\n;But when she ran the procedure, she noticed with surprise that it wasn't like the one she had in her mind.

If they do, it means that the corresponding sides are proportional and change their length uniformly. \n\nTask 2\n.....................................\n2. Two successive rectangles that one is the enlargement of the other have proportional corresponding sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
