He tries to understand the reason why the player's gaining points are higher when the arrow hits a point in the archery target -disc- that is closer to the vertex of the central angle, even though it's in the same area. To find that out, he wrote the procedure \"target\" in order to construct a circular archery target. But when he run the procedure, he realized that the avatar does not construct a disc but something different. Can you help him fix the procedure? Then, can you answer his question?\n\n;Click the papyrus button in order to read the instructions and some questions that will help you during your engagement with this activity.\n\n;-----------------------------\n;Procedure\n;...........\nto target :r :m :k\nfd :r\nrt 90\nrepeat :m [fd 3.14*:k*:r/180 rt 1]\nrt 90\nfd :r\nhome\nend\n\nclean\ntarget 30 40 1\n\n\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":"           Choosing target\n***************************\n\nTask 1\n...............................\n1.
