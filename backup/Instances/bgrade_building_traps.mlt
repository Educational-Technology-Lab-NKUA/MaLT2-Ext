{"editorCode":";         BUILDING TRAPS \r\n\r\n\r\n;Adam wants to build a model of a trap made by a hunter. The model consists of two uneven planks which form a rectangle and an isosceles triangle. On the top of these two triangle-shaped planks there is a stone that weighs :b kg. The model reveals the power from the weight of the stone acting on these two planks. He wants to find the amount of power acting on each plank-side of the trap. \r\n;Can you help him fix the procedure \"riddle\" in order for the avatar to draw properly the power arrows? \r\n\r\n;----------------        -------------\r\n\r\nTO riddle :x :b :a1 :a2 :t1 :t2\r\nplanks :x :b\r\nrt 180-:t1 fd :a1\r\npu bk :a1 lt 180-45 pd lt 180-:t2\r\nfd :a2\r\nprint 'power 1'\r\nprint :b*sin(45)\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\nclean\r\nriddle 120 50 55 45 50  20\r\n\r\n;..............\r\nto components :x :b \r\nriddle :x :b\r\nprint 'power plank 1'\r\nprint ................\r\nprint 'power plank 2'\r\nprint ..............\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\ncomponents 100 200\r\n;=========================\r\n;=========================\r\n\r\nto planks :x :b\r\nstarting_point\r\nrt 45\r\nfd (:x+:b/2)\r\nrt 90 \r\nfd (:x+:b/2)\r\npu bk (:x+:b/2) pd\r\nrt 45\r\nfd :b\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto starting_point\r\npu setxy -100 0 pd\r\nend\r\n\r\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":" BUILDING TRAPS\n ****************************\nTASK 1 \n...............................\n1. Run the procedure riddle in order to see what Adam made. Try different values for each variable using the variation tool. Try to understand the role of each variable on the procedure \"riddle\". \n\n   •    How many degrees must each of the angles :t1 and :t2 be in order for :b to be analysed correctly into its components? \nReplace the variables :t1 and :t2 with the correct invariant value.\n\n   •    Can you find the length of its component? \n\nTASK 2\n...............................\n1. Compose a conjecture on the measure of the power that you expect to act on each side. What is the relation between them?\n\n2. Complete the command \"print\" at the procedure \"components\" in order to print the measure of the power acting on each plank/ side of the triangular trap.\n\n   •    When :b=200 N, can you find the measure of the power that acts on each plank? \n\nTry this with many different values of the variable :b. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t----------------\n\t\t\t\t       TIPS\n\t\t\t\t------------------\n1.Find the measure of the angles t1 and t2 in order for :b to be analysed into two perpendicular components.  \n2.
