Is the letter \"Γ\" constructed properly? What would you change?\n\n\nTask 1\nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the trace) and change the value range of the two variables from 0 to 200.\n\nThen try various values for the two variables :a and :b, using the slides of the variation tool, in order to construct a proper letter \"Γ\".\n\nEdvin was satisfied when :a=200 and :b=100. Try these values. Do you agree with him?\n\nGo to the variation tool area and click on the vertical axis for the variable :a and the horizontal one for the variable :b.\nThe 2D Variation Tool is enabled. Click on the button \"control points\" at the 2D Variation Tool area.  \nNow, by clicking on the  2D Variation Tool screen, a blue point appears. You can drag it and observe the changes on the values of the variables and the size of letter Γ. \n\nTry to move it and let it free once a=200 and b=100.\n\nEdvin noticed that the ratio a/b equals 2. Then he thought that he would also be satisfied with the shape if a=100 and b=50. Do you agree? Why?\n\nChoose another point on the  2D Variation Tool scene and let it free once a=100 and b=50. Can you find more points in order for the value of the variables to give the ratio: a/b=2 ?\n\nTry to find more than 6 points. What to they form? Give an explanation.\n\n\nTask 2\nRun the command \"two_gammas 200 100\" which constructs two letters \"Γ\" that form a rectangle. \n\ni) Compute the ratio height/width (a/b) of the rectangle\nii) Write a formula for counting its area, using the variables: \n\nΕ= \n\nIf we change the variable b to b' so that the ratio would be a/b'=4, then what happens to the value of the area E of the rectangle? \nComplete here (or at your notebook):\n\nΕ΄= α β΄= ... α\n\nE / E' = ...\n\nTask 3\nIf you disagree with the shape of Γ based on the ratio 2 that Edvin chose, you can try another value for it.  Enable the  2D Variation Tool and explore for points that result from your choice. Compare the ratio a/b that you chose to the one that Edvin had chosen (a/b=2) and the position of the points at the  2D Variation Tool screne. \nHow can we determine if the ratio a/b is higher or lower based on the points at the  2D Variation Tool screen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
