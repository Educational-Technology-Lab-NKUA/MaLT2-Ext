Can you find the rule for arranging the tables according to the teachers?\n\nb) How many students can sit around the tables when :n=5 and :n=8 ? \nWrite a formula that calculates the number of students that can sit around the tables when there are :n tables.\n\nc) For which value of :n can 48 students sit around the tables? \nCan you write an equation that validates this value? \n\nd)Can they sit in such a layout table, 51 people?\n\nExplain your answer\n\n\nSolutions\n-------------\n\na) The rule is: If there are :n tables placed, then add :n+1 tables after the last one. Thus the arrangement has :n horizontal and :n+2 vertical tables. The corner table is counted twice \n\nb) If :n=5 then we have 5+6=11 tables, so they can sit 2*11+2=24 students.\nIf :n=8 then we have 8+9=17 tables, so they can sit 2*17+2=36 students.\n\nAll tables are 2*:n+1. So all persons that can sit are\n2*(2*:n+1)+2 persons.\nc) The equation is 2*(2*:n+1)+2 =48 so :n=11\nd) The equation is 2*(2*:n+1)+2 =51. Can this equation have natural number as a solution?
