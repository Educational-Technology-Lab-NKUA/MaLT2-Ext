{"editorCode":";\t Rhombus and rectangle\n\n;The teacher asked if a rhombus is also a rectangle and Mike answered yes. He argued  that if he knows one side and one angle of the rhombus, he can use the procedure he wrote that creates rectangles and with the appropriate parameter values he can construct a rhombus.  This, according to Mike, means that every rhombus is a special case of a rectangle.  \n\n;Do you agree with Mike's opinion?\n\n;Click the papyrus on the left to read the instructions\n;--------------PROCEDURES--------\n\nTo rectangle   :a :b :f\nrepeat 2[fd :a  rt :f \nfd :b  rt 180-:f]\nend\ncs\nrectangle 170 130 30\n\n","hiddenCode":[],"sceneCode":"","cameraPos":{"x":0,"y":1.2246467991473532e-14,"z":200},"character":"Bird","notes":"-------------Instructions-------------------\n\na) Define the procedure \"rectangle\" and execute it as \n\"rectangle  170 130 30\"\n\nTo define the procedure, select the lines from the word \"TO\" to the word \"END\" and then press the \"Insert\" button on your keyboard or the \"Run Code\" (Play) button on the right top of the editor. \n\nTo run the procedure, click on the line \"rectangle 170 130 30\" and then press the \"Insert\" button on your keyboard or the \"Run Code\" (Play) button on the right top of the editor. \n\nClick on the bird's trace to enable the sliders tool.\nUse the sliders to change the values of the variables.
