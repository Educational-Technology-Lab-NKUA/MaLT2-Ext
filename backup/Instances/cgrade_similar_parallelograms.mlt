A parallelogram and its diagonal are constructed. \nWhat is the length of its horizontal side?\nWhat is the length of its oblique side?\n\nb) The procedure \"riddle\" creates two parallelograms whose top horizontal and two left oblique lines are parallel. \nAnswer the following questions:\n     1) What is the relation between the length of the horizontal lines of the parallelograms?\n     2) What is the relation between the length of the oblique lines of the parallelograms?  \n          Use the variables k and l.\n          \n\nTASK\n----------------------------\nRun the command \"riddle 0.3 0.4\" and activate the variation tool. Set the value range of the variables from 0 to 1 and the step value to 0.05.\n\nChange the values of the variables and try to place the edge of the red parallelogram which is opposite to the avatar on the diagonal of the black parallelogram.\na) Are there many values for k and l that solve this riddle? If yes, what is the relation between them? \nb) When the riddle is solved, what geometrical relation connects the two parallelograms?\nc) Can you modify the procedure \"riddle\" in order for the red parallelogram to always have its top edge on the diagonal of the black parallelogram?\nName the new procedure \"riddle2\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
