Explore the way this line is constructed through the procedure \"triangle\".\n\nTASK\n\nEnable the variation tool (by clicking on the avatar's trace). Then try to \"close\" the broken line and form a triangle by changing the values of the variable t (that represents one of the triangle's angles), when m=10 and n=6. \nWhat kind of triangle is formed? \n\nRepeat the same with different values of the variables m and n, when m>n.\nDoes the broken line always close into a triangle?\nCan you justify your conjecture algebraically?\n\nWrite a formula that would always produce Pythagorean triples (tree positive integers that correspond to the length of one right triangle's sides).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
