The following things are constructed:\n\n an angle of t degrees, \n a green segment of invariant length (50) whose edges are on the sides of the angle\n a black segment whose length is k times the length of the green one, parallel to the green one and whose one edge is on one side of the angle\n\na) Set the value for k in order to make the black segment two times bigger than the green one.\nThen:\n      how muck must the variable l be in order for the black segment to be a homothecy of the green one, with homothetic center the edge of the angle?\n       what is the right ration of homothecy in this case?\n       Take the edges of the two segments which are on the same side of the angle (for both sides). What is the relation between their distances from the edge of the angle?\n\nb) The same as a), but by setting the value of the variable k in order for the black segment to be:\n\n       3 times bigger than the green one\n       a half of the green one\n       equal to the green one\n\nDid you ended up to a conclusion about the relation between the variables k and l (in case the black segment is a homothecy of the green one)?\nWhat does this mean for the ratios of the lengths of the two segments and the ratios of the distances of their edges from the edge of the angle?    \n\nc) Can you modify the procedures \"experiment1\" and \"experiment2\" in order to make the black segment to always be a homothecy of the green one, with l ratio of homothecy?\n\n\n\n","sliders":{},"objects":[]}
